## About the Book
Web developers have tried to break into mobile development world for quite a while by creating hybrid apps which simulated app-like behaviors but were far away from real native apps. With the emergence of React Native, the world of hybrid apps has come to an end! React Native lets developers create real mobile apps in JavaScript.

This book not only introduces you to the React Native framework but teaches you all you need to know about the mobile apps development process. This book starts with how React Native fits into the world of hybrid apps, and why it’s one of the most popular frameworks.

You'll learn how React Native works under the hood; compiling JavaScript for native modules to make the bridge between JavaScript and native apps. Write your own React Native components and use ReactJS way of structuring your app.

Also, learn how to use the industry standard Redux architecture as well as MobX – a newly emerging approach for state management for making your apps more robust and scalable.

The mobile native world can be intimidating, with lots of platform specific APIs. React Native wraps these APIs to be accessible in JavaScript. We take you through the most important ones. We look at APIs for dealing with user gestures, retrieving geolocation, accessing the camera, editing images, saving data locally and much more. With all these, you will see real world examples and use cases.

There are lots of great community packages that can speed up your development. The book will take you through the most important ones. You will learn not only how to use packages with JavaScript code but to include native modules in your application as well as writing native modules yourself and expose them to JavaScript world.

Across the book, you will see examples from Whatsapp, Instagram, Youtube apps and will be able to recreate them yourself. You will learn debugging and testing techniques, authentication, dealing with real data and much more.

At the end, we will walk through the whole process of taking Twitter app clone from design to production and releasing it to AppStore and PlayStore.

After finishing this book, you will be the confident developer of mobile apps with React Native.
